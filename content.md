## History

Manufacturing magnate Italian Ferruccio Lamborghini founded the company in 1963 with the objective of producing a refined grand touring car to compete with offerings from established marques such as Ferrari. The company's first models, such as the 350 GT, were released in the mid-1960s. Lamborghini was noted for the 1966 Miura sports coupé, which used a rear mid-engine, rear-wheel drive layout.

Lamborghini grew rapidly during its first ten years, but sales fell in the wake of the 1973 worldwide financial downturn and the oil crisis. Ferruccio Lamborghini sold the company to Georges-Henri Rossetti and René Leimer and retired in 1974. The company went bankrupt in 1978, and was placed in the receivership of brothers Jean-Claude and Patrick Mimran in 1980. The Mimrans purchased the company out of receivership by 1984 and invested heavily in its expansion. Under the Mimrans' management, Lamborghini's model line was expanded from the Countach to include the Jalpa sports car and the LM002 high-performance off-road vehicle.

## About Lamborghini

The most supercar-ish of supercar makers. Born in the Sixties out of a spat between business magnate Ferruccio Lamborghini and Enzo Ferrari, Lamborghini has long specialised in noisy, showy, exotica with unapologetic performance to match the unapologetic visuals. Though VW ownership since 1998 has arguably tempered its weirdest forays – there’s even a Lambo SUV nowadays, for heaven’s sake –Sant’Agata’s finest remains a brand best avoided by shrinking violets.

## testaminial

- The company so widely credited with establishing the mechanical template of the mid-engined supercar in the 1960s, Lamborghini has actually been tinkering and experimenting with that template ever since.
- For the participating brands it was an opportunity to present the latest in design and style. Automobili Lamborghini showcased the Revuelto, the first hybrid vehicle from the House of Sant’Agata Bolognese and a true revolution in the world of super sports cars.
- I’m thrilled that Lamborghini is once again taking part in the Autostyle Design Competition,
- commented Mitja Borkert. “The event provides a wealth of opportunities to exchange opinions and insights, and is not to be missed by enthusiasts and those who work in automotive design. It’s always a pleasure to be able to share and talk about what we see as the intrinsic style of Lamborghini DNA.
- Passion, perseverance, care and dedication. These are some of the characteristics of the people who build everything that is Automobili Lamborghini on a daily basis,
- Stephan Winkelmann, Lamborghini Chairman & CEO, commented, “I’m delighted to say that the content we have created since the first issue of the Lamborghini Magazine in 2007 resonates perfectly with my vision for Lamborghini in a way that is brave, authentic and often unexpected. We at Lamborghini passionately believed in the power of the written word and a beautifully produced magazine to tell our story, and even with the paradigm shift in communication that has occurred since, we’re still avidly celebrating all forms of story-telling.”
